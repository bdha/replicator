On receiving SIGTERM, the daemon will terminate all its subprocesses,
and exit as quickly as possible.

On receiving SIGUSR1, the daemon will wait for all groups to finish
replicating, and then will exit.

If an unexpected error occurs during any part of the replication
process, the daemon will log a report, and will stop replicating that
group.  Replication of other groups will continue normally.  To
restart replicating the stopped groups, send the daemon SIGUSR2.
