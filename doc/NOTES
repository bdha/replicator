DO NOT READ THIS FILE

IT IS THE DEVELOPER'S NOTES TO HIMSELF

================================================================

TO DO 

* a strftime escape that generates a sequence number

* quit action need not wait for end of "abide" task  (How?  Fake "is_idle" return?)

* Should only be dumped one at a time if this is not the case.

* Finish support for * in source names

* Async child processes should reset the signal handlers before doing real work

* child processes should release semaphore file?

* rename_to configuration option to control remote_host dataset name

* snapshot dumper should skip dumping snapshots that exist already

* timing on abide() is a little wrong: if the replication finishes
  within 1 sec, the abide calculation comes up with 0 instead of with
  (interval).  Filling an agenda should fill set a nominal start time,
  which should be used for timestamps and abides, in place of the real
  time.

* The "require"s in the various factory methods are going to run into
  trouble if the program chdir's to its home directory and the factory
  modules are not on the global system path.  Add a libdir config option.

* Snapshots should be objects.  Then consolidate a bunch of
  pattern-matching code and functions like _snapname.

================================================================

Split ZFS actions out of AgendaManager.  When an agenda is created, it
should be supplied with a TaskGenerator object that generates task
lists.  Then you can spin these off into a separate module.

Seems to have been done on branch AM-split, back in May!  2010-11-11.

================================================================

* What does the app do?

** Start up and handle config options and lockout
** Load config file  (-C configdir)
** Daemonize unless -x; save PID in /var

** An object represents the current status of each group

================================================================

* Typical config file

home "/var/tmp/replicator"  # Save pid file
ssh_command "ssh -o ConnectionAttempts=2 -o ConnectTimeout=10 -o BatchMode=yes"
frequency "10m"  # This option is inherited by all groups where not overridden

# A group is processed in parallel with other groups,
# but sources are processed serially
group "boxone" {   # name is optional
  source "tank/boxone/*"        # multiple sources are allowed
  remote_host "host1.example.com"  # remote_host HOST
  target "tank/boxone"          # If omitted, assume target is the same
  retire_after "12h"             # Destroy snapshots older than this
                                 # (What if the new ones aren't working?)  
  max_count 73                   # Keep around no more than 73 snapshots  
  name "repl-%T"                 # What else besides %T?  use strftime.

  group "boxone-special" { ... }

}

group "boxtwo" { 
  ...

}
