Features you would expect this to have that it does not:

1. Cleanup of old snapshots on the remote side is not implemented at all

2. Cleanup of old snapshots on the local side is implemented, but
disabled at present.  Instead, it logs a message about which snapshots
it would have destroyed, had that been enabled.
